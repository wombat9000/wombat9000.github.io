If you are reading this, odds are that you are somehow involved or interested in
software development - a complex field whose landscape is changing so rapidly,
that entire industries are in a permanent struggle to keep pace with
its latest developments.

It is a field where something new can be learned every day, and it becomes
increasingly difficult to stay on top of all the learnings one is making over
the years. Even a single week can bring about so many learnings that it becomes
a challenge to process them effectively.

Writing can serve you as a means to organise and persist your thoughts, while
also furthering your personal growth. In the following, I want to explore how.

# Sharpening The Saw
By writing, you reiterate what you already know. This process of reflection is
highly productive, because it not only brings past learnings to the forefront of
your mind again, but it also provides you with an opportunity to amend your
understanding with new ideas.

These new ideas can very naturally lead you to explore related concepts which
you have not considered before, and thus further your understanding.

# Articulate Thoughts More Concisely And Confidently
Do you know the feeling of having a good understanding of what it is you are
trying to convey, but when you actually attempt to vocalise your thoughts, you
are having trouble to articulate? If you're like me, you end up grasping for
straws and talking in circles, using too many words while conveying too little
meaning.

Writing will help you consolidate your vocabulary related to covered the topic.

# Repository Of Knowledge
After having written for a while, you will have accumulated a number of articles
on topics which you can always refer to in the future.

That discussion you had half a year ago whose learnings you wrote down came up
again? Refresh your memory and

When you discuss the topic, you can refer them to your blog.s
A blog article might be a precursor for a presentation or talk, other content
Persisting knowledge for future reference.

# Community
It can help you increase your visibility within a community, and build your own brand.
It may prompt discussions where you can learn something new.
