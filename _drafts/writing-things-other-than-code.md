If you are reading this, odds are that you are somehow involved or interested in
software development - a complex field whose landscape is changing so rapidly,
that entire industries are in a permanent struggle to keep pace with
its latest developments.

It is a field where something new can be learned every day, and it becomes
increasingly difficult to stay on top of all the learnings one is making over
the years. Even a single week can bring about so many learnings that it becomes
a challenge to process them effectively.

Writing can serve as a means to organise and persist your thoughts, while
also furthering your personal growth. In the following, I want to explore how.

# Sharpening the saw
When writing about a topic, you deepen your understanding of it. As you think
about what you are going to write, you will ask yourself questions. Sometimes
you can come up with the answer yourself, other times you will have to look it
up or do some research, causing you to learn in the process.

By writing, you reiterate what you already know. This process of reflection will
often turn out to be productive in unexpected ways, because it brings past
learnings to the forefront of your mind again. In doing so, it also makes you
explore related topics, and may lead you to new realisations. It can even make
you come up with new ideas of your own.

This is especially true for software development. With new technologies and
practices emerging almost on a daily basis, our knowledge and experience becomes
outdated quickly. Writing a blog on a recent development can help you put it
into context with what you already know and refresh your knowledge related to
the subject.

# Increase conciseness
No matter whether I am reading an email, listening to a debate, or opening my own
mouth - I often find that many words are being used without *contributing meaning*
to what is being said. Take the following example:

You will become a more effective communicator by keeping your words concise.
Reducing the amount of fluff in sentences helps the receiver to follow along and
understand the content. This is a skill which is especially valuable where there
is constant communication, such as when giving a talk, in team meetings, or even
when pair programming.  

Writing can by building your vocabulary.

As you carefully craft the sentences for your article, you also build your
vocabulary for the topic. The more elaborate your vocabulary becomes, the easier
it will be to cast your thoughts into well composed phrases . 
This vocabulary is not just useful for writing the
article, but it will also be available to you when you 

- +vocabulary
- +articulation
- +carefully crafted sentences
- +having a line of thought ready

Writing will help you consolidate your vocabulary related to covered the topic.

# Repository Of Knowledge
After having written for a while, you will have accumulated a number of articles
on topics which you can always refer to in the future.

That discussion you had half a year ago whose learnings you wrote down came up
again? Refresh your memory and

When you discuss the topic, you can refer them to your blog.s
A blog article might be a precursor for a presentation or talk, other content
Persisting knowledge for future reference.

# Community
It can help you increase your visibility within a community, and build your own
brand.
It may prompt discussions where you can learn something new.

# Demystification
- formulate question
- inner workings
- research
- supplement acquiring new skill, gain proficiency



Writing is time consuming. But in the end, its worth it through all the benefits it provides.
