If you are reading this, odds are that you are somehow involved or interested in
software development - a complex field whose landscape is changing so rapidly,
that entire industries are in a permanent struggle to keep pace with
its latest developments.

It is a field where something new can be learned every day, and it becomes
increasingly difficult to stay on top of all the learnings one is making over
the years. Even a single week can bring about so many learnings that it becomes
a challenge to process them effectively.

Writing can serve as a means to organise and persist your thoughts, while
also furthering your personal growth. In the following, I want to explore how.

# Sharpening The Saw
When writing about a topic, you deepen your understanding of it. As you think
about what you are going to write, you will ask yourself questions. Sometimes
you can come up with the answer yourself, other times you will have to look it
up or do some research, causing you to learn in the process.

By writing, you reiterate what you already know. This process of reflection will
often turn out to be productive in unexpected ways, because it brings past
learnings to the forefront of your mind again. In doing so, it also makes you
explore related topics, and may lead you to new realisations. It can even make
you come up with new ideas of your own.

This is especially true for software development. With new technologies and
practices emerging almost on a daily basis, our knowledge and experience becomes
outdated quickly. Writing a blog on a recent development can help you put it
into context with what you already know and refresh your knowledge related to
the subject.

# Articulating Thoughts More Concisely And Confidently
- +vocabulary
- +articulation
- +carefully crafted sentences
- +having a line of thought ready

Do you know the feeling of having a good understanding of what it is you are
trying to convey, but when you actually attempt to vocalise your thoughts, you
are having trouble to articulate? If you're like me, you end up grasping for
straws and talking in circles, using too many words while conveying too little
meaning.

Writing will help you consolidate your vocabulary related to covered the topic.

# Repository Of Knowledge
After having written for a while, you will have accumulated a number of articles
on topics which you can always refer to in the future.

That discussion you had half a year ago whose learnings you wrote down came up
again? Refresh your memory and

When you discuss the topic, you can refer them to your blog.s
A blog article might be a precursor for a presentation or talk, other content
Persisting knowledge for future reference.

# Community
It can help you increase your visibility within a community, and build your own
brand.
It may prompt discussions where you can learn something new.

# Demystification
- formulate question
- inner workings
- research
- supplement acquiring new skill, gain proficiency
