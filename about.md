# Hi!
I'm Bastian. I like pasta and annoying people with corny puns. Even though I'm
based in Hamburg, I spend most of my time out of town - for both work and
leisure.

I work as a software developer for [ThoughtWorks][1], where I collaborate with our
clients to create custom software and further the digital transformation of
their businesses.

When I'm not working, you are most likely going to find me playing video games,
reading a book, or hacking away at [my pet projects][2]. Most recently, I've
also taken up being the dungeon master for my D&D group which has turned out to
be an awesome experience.
